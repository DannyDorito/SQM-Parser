# Accessability Review 1 - 29th November 2018

* Side bar takes up too much of screen, should be replaced with a header
* Functions should be hidden until operations on the inputted file is complete
* Errors should be piped to dialogue component
* Better error messages in general
* Functions and options component should be merged for simplification
* When merged, parser data service can be replaced with a simple view child
* Home will be moved to app component
* Add cancel button next to confirm button
* High contrast mode is not implemented
* Buttons and labels should have the same style
* Better on hover for buttons and lables
* Opacity change on hover for interactable components
* Add icons where appropriate
